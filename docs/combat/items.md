There are four different types of items available in Crypto Colosseum.
The four categories (currently) are potions, scrolls, oils and dusts. There are three levels of rarity for each type in the current set of items.

More items will be created as the game continues to evolve.

Some items help gladiators by increasing their stats or health. Other items, often referred to as _curses_, decrease their stats or health.

Each new item is released on a bonding curve and the price fluctuates based on market demand. This means an astute player can invest and then resell powerful items as they are released.

:::tip
Note that any items applied are reset for each round within the tournament. So a potion consumed during the first round is available again for the finals.
:::

Items have variable numbers of usages and differing chances of being applied. This can have a big impact on their value and their impact on the game.
