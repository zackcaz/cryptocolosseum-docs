This documentation is a work in progress.
All statements are about the current state of the game and subject to change as the game evolves.

Tournaments for each league occur daily, in addition to more elaborate weekly tournaments.  Weekly championship matches are held for each league on Wednesdays and Fridays, and take varying forms depending on the demands of the crowd. On every other day, there are two daily tournaments for each league. These are held at the same time each day.

*** Tournament Structure ***

Each daily tournament has four participant gladiators and three matches.  All bets on those gladiators are pooled and then paid back out to the players that predicted the right overall winner.

In the "semi-finals," gladiators are separated into two pairs.  The winner of each semi-finals match qualifies for the finals, and the gladiator that wins the finals match is declared the winner of the tournament.  Each tournament can have only one winner.

The winners of each daily tournament are eligible for the weekly "Qualifier Tournament," currently held on Wednesdays and Fridays.  Those will have a larger prize pool (currently 100k PTG for Emperor's league, and 35k for Praetorian league).  Each weekly tournament's winner is then qualified for the next "Champion of Champions" tournament, which are held periodically throughout the year.  These are the pinnacle of achievement for a gladiator in the Crypto Colosseum world.

Occasionally, a special tournament such as a Free Agent tournament will be announced in addition to the standard tournament rotation.  The gladiator that wins the Free Agent tournament has their contract put up for auction!

Below you can find additional information about what different portions of the tournament page mean.

***Leagues***

Crypto Colosseum has two leagues: the Emperor's League, and the Praetorian League.

The Emperor's league is the pinnacle of competition of the Crypto Colosseum world. The Praetorian League is for up-and-comers looking to advance, and prove their worth against the very best.

Other leagues will continue to evolve beneath these leagues, feeding their champions in and allowing relegated gladiators to win their way back to glory.
